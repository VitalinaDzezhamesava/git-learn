I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro
She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you
You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose
